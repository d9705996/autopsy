# ADR 0009 — `log/slog` for structured logging

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-02

## Context

Go 1.21 added `log/slog` as a structured logging package to the standard
library, replacing the need for `zap`, `zerolog`, or `logrus` in new projects.

## Decision

Use `log/slog` exclusively.  JSON format in production, text format in
development (controlled by `LOG_FORMAT` env var).

## Consequences

- Zero external logging dependencies.
- Libraries that accept `*slog.Logger` integrate naturally.
- `slog.SetDefault` is avoided to keep the logger explicit and injectable for
  testing.
